Package: strongswan
Architecture: all
Depends: strongswan-pluto, strongswan-charon, strongswan-stroke, strongswan-crypto-plugins|strongswan-openssl, strongswan-ldap, strongswan-curl
Description: IPsec VPN solution metapackage.
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both, the IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This metapackage has dependencies to the IKEv1 daemon pluto and IKEv2 daemon
 charon. It installs the required packages to run IKEv1 and IKEv2 connections
 using a ipsec.conf/ipsec.secrets based configuration.

Package: strongswan-charon
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Conflicts: freeswan, openswan
Description: strongSwan IKEv2 keying daemon
 Charon is the IPsec IKEv2 keying daemon of the strongSwan project. It is
 written from scratch using a fully multi-threaded design and a modular
 architecture. Various plugins provide additional functionality.
 .
 This build of charon can run in parallel with pluto, the IKEv1 daemon.

Package: strongswan-pluto
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-starter, strongswan-updown
Conflicts: freeswan, openswan
Replaces: strongswan
Description: strongSwan IKEv1 keying daemon
 Pluto is a IPsec IKEv1 keying daemon. It was inherited from the FreeS/WAN
 project, but provides improved X.509 certificate support and other features.
 .
 Pluto can run in parallel with charon, the newer IKEv2 daemon.

Package: libstrongswan
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: strongSwan utility and crypto library
 libstrongswan is the underlying library of charon and other strongSwan
 components. It is built in a modular way and is extendable through various
 plugins.
 .
 This package contains a set of default plugins for the library, namely:
 x509, pubkey, hmac, xcbc and random.

Package: strongswan-starter
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-tools
Conflicts: freeswan, openswan
Description: strongSwan daemon starter and configuration file parser
 The starter and the associated "ipsec" script control both pluto and charon
 from the command line. It parses ipsec.conf and loads the configurations to
 the daemons.
 .
 To use starter with the IKEv2 daemon charon, you'll need the stroke plugin of
 the daemon. While the IKEv2 daemon can use other configuration backends, the
 IKEv1 daemon is limited to configurations from ipsec.conf.

Package: strongswan-stroke
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-charon, strongswan-starter
Description: strongSwan command line interface
 This package provides the stroke command line interface for the IKEv2 daemon
 charon and the associated daemon plugin. It allows charon to use the same
 configuration system as the IKEv1 daemon pluto, allowing smooth migration
 between IKEv1 and IKEv2 or to run both daemons in parallel.
 .
 Thisplugin is required if you want to configure IKEv2 connections through
 ipsec.conf.

Package: strongswan-updown
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: strongSwan updown script
 The keying daemons use a shell script to install firewall rules dynamically.
 This packages provides the required script files and the plugin for charon to
 invoke it.

Package: strongswan-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-crypto-plugins|strongswan-openssl
Description: Additional command line tools for strongSwan.
 This packages provides the scepclient and openac utilities.

Package: strongswan-openssl
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: strongSwan wrapper to OpenSSL crypto library
 This crypto wrapper allows libstrongswan and charon to use OpenSSL as crypto
 library. It provides various hash functions, encryption algorithms, RSA/ECDSA
 signatures and (elliptic curve) Diffie-Hellman operations.

Package: strongswan-crypto-plugins
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, libgmp3c2 (>= 4.1.4)
Description: strongSwan standalone crypto plugins
 This package contains a set of crypto plugins for libstrongswan, all
 implemented in software. It provides SHA1/SHA2/MD5/MD4 hash implementations,
 AES, single and tripple DES encryption algorithms and a RSA and Diffie-Hellman
 implementation based on the GNU Multi Precision library.

Package: strongswan-padlock
Architecture: i386
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: strongSwan VIA padlock support
 This package allows libstrongswan and charon to use the VIA padlock crypto
 accelerator. It features a hardware random number generator found on the C3
 and additional AES-128 and SHA1 support on the C7 Esther.
 .
 This package provides Padlock support in userland only. To use hardware
 acceleration for IPsec ESP packet processing, make sure to have installed
 the appropriate kernel modules.

Package: strongswan-ldap
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: LDAP fetching plugin for libstrongswan
 This plugin allows the IKEv2 keying daemon charon to fetch CRLs from an
 LDAP server.

Package: strongswan-curl
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: HTTP/FTP fetching plugin for libstrongswan
 This plugin allows the IKEv2 keying daemon charon to fetch CRLs and
 certificates from a remote server using HTTP, FTP and other protocols
 supported by cURL.

Package: strongswan-agent
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: strongSwan plugin to create signatures using SSH agent
 This plugin for libstrongswan can use a SSH agent to create RSA signatures.

Package: strongswan-eap-gtc
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-charon
Description: strongSwan EAP plugin implementing the GTC method
 The EAP-GTC method allows simple but secure username/password authentication
 with the IKEv2 keying daemon charon. Credentials are verifyied using any PAM
 service on the gateway.

Package: strongswan-eap-md5
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-charon
Description: strongSwan EAP plugin implementing the MD5 (CHAP) method
 The EAP-MD5 method allows username/password authentication with the IKEv2
 keying daemon charon.

Package: strongswan-eap-mschapv2
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-charon
Description: strongSwan EAP plugin implementing the MSCHAPv2 method
 The EAP-MSCHAPv2 method allows username/password authentication with the IKEv2
 keying daemon charon. It is designed work in conjunction with Windows 7
 Agile VPN clients or with Windows 2008 R2 Servers.

Package: strongswan-nm
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, strongswan-charon, network-manager (>= 0.7~~svn20080818)
Description: strongSwan plugin to interact with NetworkManager
 This plugin provides an interface which allows NetworkManager to configure
 and control the IKEv2 daemon directly through DBUS. It is designed to work
 in conjunction with the network-manager-strongswan package, providing
 a simple graphical frontend to configure IPsec based VPNs.
