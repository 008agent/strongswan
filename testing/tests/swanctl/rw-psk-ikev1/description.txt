The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on two <b>pre-shared keys</b>
bound to the two distinct gateway identities <b>moon1.strongswan.org</b> and
<b>moon2.strongswan.org</b>. On the gateway these two identities are bound to
two disjoint sets of client IP address ranges which allows IKEv1 Main Mode
to select the correct connection definition and via the gateway identity the
correct PSK.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, <b>carol</b> pings the
client <b>alice</b> and <b>dave</b> the client <b>venus</b> lying in two different
subnets behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
