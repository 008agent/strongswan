The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The strong mutual authentication is based on <b>EAP-TTLS</b> only (without a separate IKEv2
authentication) with the gateway being authenticated by a server certificate during the
EAP-TLS tunnel setup (phase1 of EAP-TTLS). This tunnel protects the ensuing weak client
authentication based on <b>EAP-MD5</b> (phase2 of EAP-TTLS). <b>carol</b> presents the
correct MD5 password and succeeds whereas <b>dave</b> chooses the wrong password and fails.
