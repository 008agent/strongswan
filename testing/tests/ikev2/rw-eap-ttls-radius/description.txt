The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
At the outset the gateway authenticates itself to the client by sending
an IKEv2 <b>RSA signature</b> accompanied by a certificate.
<b>carol</b> then sets up an <b>EAP-TTLS</b> tunnel via <b>moon</b> to
the FreeRADIUS server <b>alice</b> authenticated by an X.509 AAA certificate.
The strong EAP-TTLS tunnel protects the ensuing weak client authentication
based on <b>EAP-MD5</b>.
