   3. Building and running strongSwan with a Linux 2.6 kernel


1. Required packages
   -----------------

   In order to be able to build strongSwan you'll need the GNU Multiprecision
   Arithmetic Library (GMP) available from http://www.swox.com/gmp/.

   The libgmp library and the corresponding header file gmp.h are usually
   included in the form of one or two packages in the major Linux
   distributions (SuSE: gmp; Debian unstable:  libgmp3, libgmp3-dev).


2. Optional packages
   -----------------

2.1 libcurl
    -------

   If you intend to dynamically fetch Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
   from an HTTP server or as an alternative want to use the Online
   Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) then you will need the  libcurl library
   available from http://curl.haxx.se/.

   In order to keep the library as compact as possible for use with strongSwan
   you can build libcurl from the sources with the optimized options

       ./configure --prefix=<dir> --without-ssl \
                   --disable-ldap --disable-telnet \
                   --disable-dict --disable-gopher \
                   --disable-debug \
                   --enable-nonblocking --enable-thread

   As an alternative you can use the ready-made packages included with your
   favorite Linux distribution (SuSE: curl, curl-devel).

   In order to activate the use of the libcurl library in strongSwan you must
   set the USE_LIBCURL option in "Makefile.inc":

       # include libcurl support (CRL fetching, OCSP and SCEP)
       USE_LIBCURL?=true

   Under Gentoo emerge strongSwan with

       USE="curl -ssl" emerge strongswan


2.2 OpenLDAP
    --------

   If you intend to dynamically fetch Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
   from an LDAP server  then you will need the libldap library available
   from http://www.openldap.org/.

    OpenLDAP is usually included  with your Linux distribution. You will need
   both the run-time and development environments (SuSE: openldap2,
   openldap2-devel).

   In order to activate the use of the libldap library in strongSwan you must
   set the USE_LDAP option in "Makefile.inc":

       # include LDAP support (CRL fetching)
       USE_LDAP?=true

   Depending upon whether your LDAP server understands the V3 (preferred) or
   V2 LDAP protocol, uncomment one ot the two following lines:

       # Uncomment to enable dynamic CRL fetching using LDAP V3
       LDAP_VERSION=3
       # Uncomment to enable dynamic CRL fetching using LDAP V2
       #LDAP_VERSION=2

   The latest OpenLDAP releases use the LDAP V3 protocol, whereas older
   versions require LDAP V2.

   Under Gentoo emerge strongSwan with

       USE="ldap -ssl" emerge strongswan


2.3 PKCS#11 smartcard library modules
    ---------------------------------

   If you want to securely store your X.509 certificates and private RSA keys
   on a smart card or a USB crypto token then you will need a PKCS #11 library 
   for the smart card of your choice. The OpenSC PKCS#11 library (use
   versions >= 0.9.4) available from http://www.opensc.org/ supports quite a
   selection of cards and tokens (e.g. Aladdin eToken Pro32k, Schlumberger
   Cryptoflex e-gate, Oberthur AuthentIC,  etc.) but requires that a PKCS#15
   directory structure be present on the smart card. But in principle
   any other PKCS#11 library could be used since the PKCS#11 API hides the
   internal data representation on the card.

   For USB crypto token support you must add the OpenCT driver library
   (version >= 0.6.2) from the OpenSC site, whereas for serial smartcard
   readers you'll need the pcsc-lite library and the matching driver from the
   M.U.S.C.L.E project http://www.linuxnet.com/ .

   In order to activate the PKCS#11-based smartcard support in strongSwan
   you must set the USE_SMARTCARD option in "Makefile.inc":

       #include PKCS11-based smartcard support
       USE_SMARTCARD?=true

   During compilation no externel smart card libraries must be present.
   strongSwan directly references a copy of the standard RSAREF pkcs11.h
   header files stored in the pluto/rsaref sub directory. During compile
   time a pathname to a default PKCS#11 dynamical library can be specified
   in "Makefile.inc" 

      # Uncomment this line if using OpenSC <= 0.9.6
      # PKCS11_DEFAULT_LIB=\"/usr/lib/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so\"
      # Uncomment tis line if using OpenSC >= 0.10.0
        PKCS11_DEFAULT_LIB=\"usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so\"

   This default path to the easily-obtainable OpenSC library module can be
   simply overridden during run-time by specifying an alternative path in
   ipsec.conf pointing to any dynamic PKCS#11 library of your choice.

   config setup
          pkcs11module="/usr/lib/xyz-pkcs11.so"

   Under Gentoo emerge strongSwan with

       USE="smartcard usb -pam -X" emerge strongswan



3. Building and running strongSwan with a Linux 2.6 kernel
   -------------------------------------------------------

   * Because the Linux 2.6 kernel comes with a built-in native IPsec stack,
     you won't need to build the strongSwan kernel modules. Please make sure 
     that the the following Linux 2.6 IPsec kernel modules are available:

         o af_key
         o ah4
         o esp4
         o ipcomp
         o xfrm_user
         o xfrm_tunnel

     Also the built-in kernel Cryptoapi modules with selected encryption and 
     hash algorithms should be available.

   * First select any desired compile options in "Makefile.inc" (see section 2.
     Optional packages). Then in the  strongwan-4.x.x  top directory type

         make

     followed by

         make install

   * Next add your connections to "/etc/ipsec.conf" and your secrets to 
     "/etc/ipsec.secrets". Connections that are to be negotiated by the new
     IKEv2 charon keying daemon should be designated by "keyexchange=ikev2" and 
     those by the IKEv1 pluto keying daemon either by "keyexchange=ikev1" or
     the default "keyexchange=ike".

   * At last start strongSwan with

         ipsec start
