import of strongswan-2.7.0
applied patch for charon
renamed get_block_size of hasher

using ID_ANY for any, not NULL as before
initiator sends IDr payload in IKE_AUTH when ID unique
fixed charon checks
using status & statusall
patch for 2.7.0 
add connection names to connections
stroke status / ipsec status shows them
added statusall for stroke
added status by connection name
some tests repaired, more to come
fixed spi conversion
improved "stroke status" output
setup PID file after daemon initilization, to correctly inform
  starter about daemon startup
added separate implementation for connection_store, credential_store, policy_store
added folder structure to config
credentials are fetched solely on IDs now
identification_t supports now almost all id types
x509 certificates work with identification_t now
fixes here, fixes there
fixed doxygen build
seperates now in lib and charon
library initialization done at a central point (library.c)
some leak_detective fixes
updated Todos
fixed log-to-syslog behavior
added patch against strongswan-2.6.4
x509 certificate loading with pluto asn1 code
x509 needs a lot more attention!
renamed some files
using asn1 pluto stuff now
removed, since we use pluto asn1 stuff
leak detective is usable, but does not show static function names
  a script which gets address via ldd and resolves address via addr2line would be nice
fixed a leak in child_sa with new detective ;-)
some improvements to new asn1 stuff
to be continued
fixed bad bugs in kernel interface
added some logging info
works now much more stable
startet importing pluto ASN1 stuff
der PKCS#1 key loading works (as it did with der_decoder)
split up in libstrong, charon, stroke, testing done
new leak detective with malloc hook in library
  useable, but needs improvements
logger_manager has now a single instance per library
  allows use of loggers from any linking prog
a LOT of other things
../svn-commit.tmp
added misssing stroke.h
improved strokeing
  down connection
  status
some other tweaks
rewrote a lot of RSA stuff
done major work for ASN1/decoder
allow loading of ASN1 der encoded private keys, public keys and certificates
extracting public key from certificates
passing certificates from stroke to charon
=> basic authentication with RSA certificates works!
starter work on asn1 with der de/encoder
RSA private and public key can load read key from ASN1 DER
some other fixes here and there
rewrite of logger_manager, uses now one instance per context
cleanups for logger here and there
removed critical flag check in payload verification (conformance to IKEv2)
so thats and theres everywere... ;-)
patch for strongswan-2.6.3
added charon support for strongswan build process
ipsec starter supports charon startup and control
removed old diploma thesis scripts
some cleanups
compatibility to strongswan, Makefile can be called by "make programs"
  and "make install" (ikev2 patch must be applied to strongswan)
first version of stroke control utility
moved output to doc/api, since doc is used for other docs now
some first documentation in english
removed old eclipse project files
works quite well now with ipsec.conf & ipsec starter
belongs to previous commit ;-)
reworked configuration framework completly
configuration is now split up in: connections, policies, credentials and daemon config
further alloc/free fixes needed!
first attempt for connection loading and starting via "stroke"
some improvements here and there
configuration_manager replaced by configuration_t interface
current configuration_manager is now static_configuration (testing)
first draft of starter_configuration, which should once interact with ipsec starter (via whack?)
some cleanups
socket_t uses RAW socket, which allows parallel service of pluto/charon
comments and cleanups
working policy installation and removal
fixed policy setup bug
proposal setup implementation begun
fixed socket code, so we know on which address we receive traffic
AH/ESP setup in kernel is working now!!! :-)))
installing of child sa works
need correct IP adresses to actually use IPsec

key derivation for child_sa works
some fixes here and there
fixed memleaks
