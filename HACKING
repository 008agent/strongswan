Subversion repository
---------------------

For interested developers, we have a public repository. To check out and 
compile the code, you need the following tools:

    - Subversion (1.3.1)
    - a recent GNU C complier (gcc-3.4.6)
    - recent autotools (autoconf-2.59, automake-1.9.6, libtool-1.5.22)
    - the usual strongSwan dependencies (gmp >= 4.1.4, optional curl, ldap)
    - perl (5.8.8)
    - lex (flex-2.5.33)
    - yacc (bison-2.1)
    - gperf (3.0.1)
    - Doxygen (1.4.6)

The numbers in brackets represent the versions used on our development systems,
other version MAY work, too. Not all tools are checked by the configure script,
as they are not needed in the tarball distributions, so check them manually.

To check out the trunk, use:

    svn co http://www.strongswan.org/ikev2/trunk strongswan

After a successful check out, give the autotools a try:

    cd strongswan/
    ./autogen.sh

Then you're in, start the build as usual:

    ./configure [options]
    make
    make install


uClibc support
--------------

Support for uClibc is still work in progress. To get startet with strongSwan
on uClibc, yoou need version which supports getifaddrs ( > 0.9.28).
Additionally, you need the at least the following options:

String and Stdio Support --->
  [*] Support glibc's register_printf_function()
  [*] Support the '%m' specifier in printf format strings
General Library Settings --->
  [*] Support global constructors and destructors

We must reduce the number of printf handlers, as uClibc only supports 10 of
them. It is fairly untested yet, so don't except to get it running without
further tweaks.
