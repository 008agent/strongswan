                  strongSwan - Roadmap
                 -------------------------

These notes mostly belong to charon, the new IKEv2 daemon. The plan is to
migrate IKEv1 into charon. It's hard to say how much effort is needed to
do that, and how much code we can reuse from pluto. But a port IS necessary to
gain hassle-free confiugration, version negotiation and maintainability.

Roadmap for 2007
================

 Jan  !   - first stable release of the strongSwan 4.x branch
      !
 Feb  !   - refactoring of exchange handling for better code sharing,
      !     we need to separate specific tasks to reuse them in multiple
      !     exchanges

      !   - merge of the virtual IP support currently in the pipeline
      !
 Mar  !   - interface in charon for the new SMP management interface
      !   - full certificate support
      !   - Cookie support, other fixes to mature against DoS
      !   - merge of the experimental "mediated double-NAT" support
      !   - write an IETF draft for this feature
      !
 Apr  !   - start porting efforts of IKEv1 into charon
      !   - support of IKEv1 messages and payloads in charon
      !
 May  !   - migration of plutos state machine into charon
      !
 Jun  !   - get a useable IKEv1 implementation for simple cases
      !
 Jul  !   - first release of charon supporting IKEv2 and IKEv1
      !
 Aug  !   - get IKEv1 support to the level of pluto
      !

TODO-List
=========

A set of TODOs. This is only a list of things I write down to not forget them.
Watch out for TODOs in the code.
  
Build system
------------
- configure flag which allows to ommit vendor id in pluto
- reduce printf handlers count to 10, as uClibc does not support more

Denail of service
-----------------
- Cookie support on server
- thread exhaustion (multiple messages to a single IKE_SA)

Certificate support
-------------------
- New trustchain mechanism?
- proper handling of multiple certificate payloads (import order)
- synchronized CRL fetcher
- Smartcard interface
- Attribute certificates

Stroke interface
----------------
- add a Rekey-Counter for SAs in "statusall"
- ipsec statusall bytecount
- proper handling of CTRL+C console detach (SIG_PIPE)

Misc
----
- retry transaction on failure while keyingtries > 1
- PFS support for creating/rekeying CHILD_SAs
- Address pool/backend for virtual IP assignement
